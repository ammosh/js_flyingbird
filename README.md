# js_flyingbird
A simple JS game - flying bird

The game's main character is a flying bird (and hungry!!) which is looking for seeds. The bird needs to fetch the seeds for survival, and you need to help her for adding to your score :).

In this game, I implemented the gravity and also reflexive bouncing. The bird is always dropping and you should avoid it by holding the up key. In addition, you can move the bird to the right, left, and bottom (with a fixed acceleration) as well (using the keyboard arrow keys).
